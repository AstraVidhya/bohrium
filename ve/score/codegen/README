dispatch.ctpl - This template is no longer needed since it has been replaced with 'get_traverse'.
                The dispatch code is now simply a call to get_traverse and then executing the
                received traversal function-pointer. The point is that discatch.cpp no longer
                needs a bunch of code generation and it could be deprecated completely.
                The template however remains here for potential later inspection.

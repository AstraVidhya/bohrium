Testing the Bohrium CPP Interface
---------------------------------

Requires that you have the Google Test Framework as well as CMake installed::

    # Install dependencies from your package repository
    sudo apt-get instal cmake make
    # Download gtest source and unpack it
    wget https://googletest.googlecode.com/files/gtest-1.6.0.zip
    unzip gtest-1.6.0.zip
    mkdir gtest
    mv gtest-1.6.0/* gtest/
    rmdir gtest-1.6.0

The source distribution contains a bunch of unittest-samples and examples of build-environment setup. You can explore gtest/samples for inspiration on writing tests. Anyway... compile and run the tests with::

    cd gtest
    ./configure
    make clean all
    cd ..
    make run

A bunch of green and possibly red should then light up your terminal.

Notes on Visualization
======================

One can use the graph-visualization script like so::

    # Install a version of naive with debugging enabled
    cd ve/naive

    # Make sure that INSTALLDIR points to where you install your bohrium libs...
    DEBUG="-DDEBUG" INSTALLDIR=~/bohrium.lib/ make clean all install

    # Then run whatever you want to get a graph of, such as
    python ../../benchmark/Python/jacobi.iterative.py --size=10*10*10 --bohrium=True > example.trace
    
    # Then run the "visualizer"
    ./visualize.sh

This should generate a .svg file based on the 'example.trace' file and start a browser to show it.

In order to update the docker image that travis builds at each run, simply modify bohrium.dockerfile.
NB: no need to upload a new image to docker hub!

When modifying the base image, you have to upload a new docker image to docker hub.
In the root dir of Bohrium run:

sudo docker build -t bohrium/ubuntu:16.04 -f package/docker/bohrium.dockerfile .
sudo docker push

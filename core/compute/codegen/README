The gen.*.py scripts generates the following files:

 functors.hpp
   A set of cpp functors, they are used to perform the inner-most logic of a whole-array operation. Such as: op1 = op2 + op3.

 traverers.hpp
   Contains the logic for traversing through arrays and applying functors / element-wise operations.

 cphvb_compute.cpp
   Maps opcode to traversal+functor pair, either by returning a pointer to the traversal function with an inlined functor or directly invoking the traversal function.

The code-generation is based on the *.ctpl files which are c/c++ code with Python Cheetah string-template annotations.
